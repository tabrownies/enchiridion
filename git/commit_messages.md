Articulate some of the principles and patterns that are beneficial and helpful to have good commit comments.  In summary they are:

1. 1st Line is a short description of what the change is and why, very succinctly done. <=50 characters. It helps a lot...
2. 2nd Line is ALWAYS blank
3. 3rd Line etc. detailed description of what/why the change was made.  The details should be helpful should anyone want to review or better understand the purpose of the commit.  There are too many specifics of what a good detailed commit is; the afore mentioned web pages do a decent job of describing this.
