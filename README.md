# Welcome to the Enchiridion of Timothy
Essentially a growing corpus of personal coding notes written while listening to 80s rock. Tbh it's mostly for myself, so don't judge the progressively unprofessional rhetoric. If you're unhappy with my priority of content, clarity, and accuracy over formalism and stylistic consistency, please make a GitHub issue. I'll ignore it, but at least you'll feel better ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Of course, I'm open to critique that helps the content, so if you (assuming *anyone* besides me ever reads this) find and issue, open an issue, create a pull request, etc. If you don't understand those things, look in [this](#) folder.

Atomic Batteries to Power, Turbines to Speed.

Let's go.

# Contents
 - [Deployment](./deployment/deployment_overview.md)


# Style guide for this
 - In each folder, there are two files: given folder name <name>, they are <name>_overview.md which details the contents of the folder <name>_resources.md which contains a list of linked resources for that topic.
