# Extensions
 - git blame (eamodio.gitlens)
 - VSCode Neovim (asvetliakov.vscode-neovim)
    - I use [this cheatsheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/)
    - On a Mac, holding down the keys doesn't make them repeat, which is bad for navigation in Vim/Neovim. I used the following command to fix this ```defaults write NSGlobalDomain ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false``` This was sourced from [this website](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/01/14/how-to-enable-key-repeats-on-your-mac/). After doing this, I had to restart my Mac for it to take effect.
